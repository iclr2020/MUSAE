### Abstract

<p align="justify">
We present network embedding algorithms that capture information about a node from the local distribution over node attributes around it, as observed over random walks following an approach similar to Skip-gram. Observations from neighborhoods of different sizes are either pooled (AE) or encoded distinctly in a multi-scale approach (MUSAE). Capturing attribute-neighborhood relationships over multiple scales is useful for a diverse range of applications, including latent feature identification across disconnected networks with similar attributes. We prove theoretically that matrices of node-feature pointwise mutual information are implicitly factorized by the embeddings. Experiments show that our algorithms are robust, computationally efficient and outperform comparable models on social, web and citation network datasets.</p>

The second-order random walk sampling method was taken from the reference implementation of [Node2Vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec).

### Requirements
The codebase is implemented in Python 3.5.2. package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          1.11
tqdm              4.28.1
numpy             1.15.4
pandas            0.23.4
texttable         1.5.0
scipy             1.1.0
argparse          1.1.0
gensim            3.6.0
```
### Datasets

### Logging

The models are defined in a way that parameter settings and runtimes are logged. Specifically we log the followings:

```
1. Hyperparameter settings.     We save each hyperparameter used in the experiment.
2. Optimization runtime.        We measure the time needed for optimization - measured by seconds.
3. Sampling runtime.            We measure the time needed for sampling - measured by seconds.
```

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/main.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.
